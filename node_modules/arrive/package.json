  "readme": "# arrive.js\n\narrive.js provides events to watch for DOM elements creation and removal. It makes use of [Mutation Observers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) internally.\n\nDownload [arrive.min.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uzairfarooq/arrive/master/minified/arrive.min.js) (latest)\n\nor use [Bower](http://bower.io/) to install:\n\n```bash\n# install arrive.js and add it to bower.json dependencies\n$ bower install arrive --save\n```\n\n##### Node.js / NPM\nNode.js users can install using npm:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install arrive --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n**The library does not depend on jQuery, you can replace jQuery elements in the examples below with pure javascript elements and it would work fine.**\n###Watch for elements creation\nUse `arrive` event to watch for elements creation:\n```javascript\n// watch for creation of an element which satisfies the selector \".test-elem\"\n$(document).arrive(\".test-elem\", function() {\n    // 'this' refers to the newly created element\n    var $newElem = $(this);\n});\n\n// the above event would watch for creation of element in whole document\n// it's better to be more specific whenever possible, for example\n$(\".container-1\").arrive(\".test-elem\", function() {\n    var $newElem = $(this);\n});\n```\n\nIn pure javascript you can call the function on `document`, `window`, any `HTMLElement` or `NodeList`, like this:\n```javascript\n// watch for element creation in the whole HTML document\ndocument.arrive(\".test-elem\", function() {\n    // 'this' refers to the newly created element\n});\n\n// this will attach arrive event to all elements in the NodeList\ndocument.getElementsByClass(\".container-1\").arrive(\".test-elem\", function() {\n    // 'this' refers to the newly created element\n});\n```\n\nMake sure to remove listeners when they are no longer needed, it's better for performance:\n```javascript\n// unbind all arrive events on document element\n$(document).unbindArrive();\n\n// unbind all arrive events on document element which are watching for \".test-elem\" selector\n$(document).unbindArrive(\".test-elem\");\n\n// unbind only a specific callback\n$(document).unbindArrive(callbackFunc);\n\n// unbind only a specific callback on \".test-elem\" selector\n$(document).unbindArrive(\".test-elem\", callbackFunc);\n\n// unbind all arrive events\nArrive.unbindAllArrive();\n```\n\n####Options\nAs of v2.0 `arrive` event accepts an optional `options` object as 2nd argument. Options object consists of following:\n```javascript\nvar options = {\n    fireOnAttributesModification: boolean, // Defaults to false. Setting it to true would make arrive event fire on existing elements which start to satisfy selector after some modification in DOM attributes (an arrive event won't fire twice for a single element even if the option is true). If false, it'd only fire for newly created elements.\n    onceOnly: boolean                      // Defaults to false. Setting it to true would ensure that registered callbacks fire only once. No need to unbind the event if the attribute is set to true, it'll automatically unbind after firing once.\n    existing: boolean                      // Defaults to false. Setting it to true would ensure that the registered callback is fired for the elements that already exists in the DOM and match the selector. If options.onceOnly is set, the callback is only called once with the first element matching the selector.\n};\n```\nExample:\n```javascript\n$(document).arrive(\".test-elem\", {fireOnAttributesModification: true}, function() {\n    // 'this' refers to the newly created element\n    var $newElem = $(this);\n});\n```\n\n###Watch for elements removal\nUse `leave` event to watch for elements removal.\nThe first arugument to leave must not be a [descendent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_selectors) or [child](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_selectors) selector i.e. you cannot pass `.page .test-elem`, instead, pass `.test-elem`. It's because of a limitation in MutationObserver's api.\n\n```javascript\n// watch for removal of an element which satisfies the selector \".test-elem\"\n$(\".container-1\").leave(\".test-elem\", function() {\n    var $removedElem = $(this);\n});\n```\n\nYou can unbind the `leave` event in the same way as `arrive` event, using `unbindLeave` function i.e:\n\n```javascript\n// unbind all leave events on document element\n$(document).unbindLeave();\n\n// unbind all leave events\nArrive.unbindAllLeave();\n```\n\n\n##Browser Support\narrive.js is built over [Mutation Observers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) which is introduced in DOM4. It's supported in latest versions of all popular browsers.\n\n| Browser           | Supported Versions\n| ------------------|:-----------------:|\n| Google Chrome     | 27.0+             |\n| Firefox           | 14.0+             |\n| Safari            | 6.1+              |\n| Internet Explorer | 11.0+             |\n| Opera             | 14.0+             |\n\n##Contributing\n####Report a bug / Request a feature\nIf you want to report a bug or request a feature, use the [Issues](https://github.com/uzairfarooq/arrive/issues) section. Before creating a new issue, search the existing ones to make sure that you're not creating a duplicate. When reporting a bug, be sure to include OS/browser version and steps/code to reproduce the bug, a [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) would be great.\n\n####Development\nIf you want ot contribute to arrive, here is the workflow you should use:\n\n1. Fork the repository.\n2. Clone the forked repository locally.\n3. From the `dev` branch, create and checkout a new feature branch to work upon. (If you want to work on some minor bug fix, you can skip this step and continue to work in `dev` branch)\n4. Make your changes in that branch (the actual source file is `/src/arrive.js`).\n5. If sensible, add some jasmine tests in `/tests/spec/arriveSpec.js` file.\n6. Make sure there are no regressions by executing the unit tests by opening the file `/tests/SpecRunner.html` in a browser. There is a button 'Run tests without jQuery' at the top left of th page, click that button to make sure that the tests passes without jQuery. Run the test cases in all major browsers.\n7. Push the changes to your github repository.\n8. Submit a pull request from your repo back to the original repository.\n9. Once it is accepted, remember to pull those changes back into your develop branch!\n\n\n**Keywords**\n\njavascript, js, jquery, node.js, watch, listen, creation, dynamically, removal, new, elements, DOM, dynamic, detect, insertions, event, bind, live, livequery\n",
